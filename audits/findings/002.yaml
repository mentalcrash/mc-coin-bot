description: |
  PortfolioManager does not guard against cash going negative
  when opening new positions. Insufficient funds check is missing.
impact: |
  Negative cash balance in live mode could trigger margin call or
  unintended leverage.
proposed_fix: Add pre-trade cash sufficiency check in PM before order emission.
