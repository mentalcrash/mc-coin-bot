description: 'PositionReconciler detects drift between exchange and PM positions

  but only logs warnings without auto-correction. 5% drift threshold

  is detection-only.

  '
impact: 'Position drift accumulates silently in live mode.

  Manual intervention required.

  '
proposed_fix: Add optional auto-correction mode with configurable threshold.
