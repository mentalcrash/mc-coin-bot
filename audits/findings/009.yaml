severity: medium
category: architecture
status: open

description: |
  BAR events use put_nowait (DROPPABLE). When queue is full,
  events are silently dropped with only a log warning.
  No metric or alert for dropped events.
impact: |
  Missed bars in high-frequency scenarios without operator awareness.
proposed_fix: Add dropped event counter metric for monitoring.
