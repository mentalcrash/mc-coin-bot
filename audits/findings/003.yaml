title: LiveExecutor assert statements in production path
severity: critical
category: risk-safety
status: open
location: src/eda/executors.py
description: |
  LiveExecutor uses assert statements for critical validations.
  Running with python -O strips all asserts, silently skipping checks.
impact: |
  Production deployment with optimization flags would bypass
  critical safety checks.
proposed_fix: Replace assert with explicit if/raise ValueError or custom exceptions.
